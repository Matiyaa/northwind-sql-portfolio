# Northwind SQL Portfolio - Advanced Analytics Journey

A comprehensive SQL learning project demonstrating progression from foundational techniques to advanced business analytics using the classic Northwind Traders dataset.

## Project Overview

**Goal**: Build demonstrable "advanced SQL" skills for mid-level analytics roles through progressive challenge-based learning, moving from basic queries to sophisticated business intelligence analysis.

**Approach**: Solve realistic business problems using Microsoft SQL Server (T-SQL), with each challenge building complexity while maintaining practical business relevance.

**Portfolio Strategy**: Dual showcase combining technical proficiency (GitHub) with business insights (Notion).

## Learning Structure

### Phase 1: Foundation Reinforcement ✅
**Focus**: Core syntax mastery, essential functions, basic aggregation

#### Challenge 1: Business Intelligence Briefing ✅
*Scenario: New data analyst conducting comprehensive business overview*

**Business Questions Solved:**
- Data inventory and structure assessment
- Business scale analysis (customers, products, orders, employees)
- Geographic operational reach
- Temporal data coverage
- Data quality validation framework

**SQL Techniques Applied:**
- Information schema queries for database discovery
- Subquery patterns for efficient aggregation
- UNION operations for geographic analysis
- Conditional logic with CASE WHEN statements
- Referential integrity validation
